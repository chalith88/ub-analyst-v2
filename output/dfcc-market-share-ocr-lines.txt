[6] DFCC Bank maintained its robust performance for the period ended 30 September 2025,
[7] underscoring its financial resilience and the success of its strategic initiatives. The Bank
[8] delivered solid results during this period, with consistent growth across key performance
[9] indicators. Loan and deposit volumes expanded meaningfully, while Net Interest Income
[10] rose by 11%, reflecting disciplined asset - liability management and robust strategic
[11] initiatives . This performance highlights the Bank’s ongoing emphasis on credit expansion
[12] and funding optimisation, reaffirming its commitment to creating long - term value for both
[13] shareholders and customers.
[14] DFCC Bank sustained its focus on balance sheet growth, recording a 26% increase in loans
[15] and a 22% increase in deposits - driven by a strategy designed to capitalise on the easing
[16] interest rate environment. This growth aligns with DFCC Bank’s co ntinued support for
[17] national economic recovery through targeted lending. Reflecting broader market dynamics,
[18] private sector credit also showed a strong upward trend, fuelled by lower interest rates and
[19] a rebound in economic activity. The modest increase in interest income for the period
[20] marked a turnaround from earlier periods affected by rate compression, enabled by growth
[21] in lending volumes and a stronger CASA base.
[22] In Q3 2025, DFCC Bank also marked a major milestone with the launch of Sri Lanka’s first
[23] B lue Bond - an LKR 3 B n initiative to support ocean - positive SMEs and climate adaptation,
[24] further reinforcing its leadership in sustainable finance. The Bank also commemorated its
[25] 70th anniversary during the quarter by introducing a suite of special Fixed Deposit products
[26] to rewa rd loyal customers and deepen relationships.
[27] In recognition of its continued impact, DFCC Bank was officially certified as a Great Place to
[28] th
[29] Work, and was ranked 4 in the AICPA & CIMA Top 20 Employers in Sri Lanka. It was also
[30] declared as the Best Bank i n MSME Acceleration at the ICC Emerging Asia Banking Awards
[31] 2025. Other accolades included recognition among Sri Lanka’s Top 30 Most Valuable and
[32] Strongest Brands by Brand Finance (ranked 27th), and wins at SLIM Digis 2.5 for Best Use of
[33] AI Technologies (M erit) and Best SEO/SEM Campaign (Silver).
[34] This commentary relates to the unaudited financial statements for the period ended 30
[35] September 2025, presented in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting Standard 34 (LKAS 34)
[36] on Interim Financial Statements.
[37] Income Statement Analysis
[38] Profitability
[39] DFCC Bank PLC, the largest entity within the Group, recorded a Prof it Before Tax (PBT) of
[40] LKR 12,151 Mn and a Pro fit After Tax (PAT) of LKR 8,328 Mn from continuing operations ,
[41] compared to a PBT of LKR 9,559 Mn and a PAT of LKR 6,013 Mn in the same period last year.
[42] The Bank’s Earnings Per Share (EPS) fr om core operations was LKR 19.07 , while the EPS
[43] including the gain from the disposal of its stake in Acuity Partners (Pvt) Ltd stood at LKR
[44] 30.44 .
[45] A t Group level, PBT was L KR 12,480 Mn and PAT was LKR 8,530 Mn , from continuing
[46] operations, compared to LKR 9,909 Mn and LKR 6,308 Mn, respectively, in 2024.
[47] The Bank’s Retur n on Equity (ROE) stood at 15.85 %, while Return on Assets (ROA) before
[48] tax was 2. 7 1 % for the period ended 3 0 September 2025 , inclusive of the disposal gain
[49] recorded under profit from discontinued operations.
[50] Net Interest Income
[51] During the period, DFCC Bank recorded a 4% increase in interest income while containing
[52] interest expenses , highlighting the Bank’s operational resilience and disciplined margin
[53] management amid a challenging rate environment. This growth was primarily fue l led by a
[54] 26% expansion in the loan portfolio, underscoring DFCC’s strategic focus on quality asset
[55] growth. Achieved within a subdued interest rate landscape, this performance reflects the
[56] Bank’s prudent lending practices and effective portfolio management, reinforcing its
[57] commitment to sustainable financial performance .
[58] Net Interest Income, the Bank’s core ear nings driver, in creased by 11% to LKR 22,969 Mn,
[59] driven by effective loan book expansion and funding cost optimization while maintaining a
[60] robust CASA ratio. Driven by a 25% growth in the CASA portfolio compared to the previous
[61] period, the CASA ratio incre ased from 24.77% as of 31 December 2024 to 25.34% as at 30
[62] September 2025 , reflecting a stronger deposit mix and improved funding cost efficiency.
[63] However, the Net Interest Margin declined from 4.18% in December 2024 to 3.95 % by
[64] September 2025, largely due to the Bank’s competitive positioning and prevailing market
[65] dynamics.
[66] Fee and Commission Income
[67] DFCC Bank’s proactive strategies continued to yield strong results, driving higher volumes
[68] across remittances, credit - related charges, trade commissions, and other fee - generating
[69] activities. Growth in the credit card portfolio further contributed to this momentum.
[70] While fee - related expenses rose in line wi th customer acquisition and portfolio expansion
[71] efforts, the net impact remained firmly positive. Consequently , net fee and commission
[72] income surged by 48% year - on - year, reaching LKR 5,281 Mn compared to LKR 3,561 Mn in
[73] the corresponding period of 2024. Th is growth reflects the Bank’s focus on scaling non -
[74] interest income streams effectively.
[75] Impairment Charge on Loans and Other Losses
[76] The Stage 3 imp aired loan ratio improved to 4.8 2% as at 30 September 2025 , from 5.65% as
[77] at 31 December 2024 , driven by suc cessful recoveries and portfolio growth .
[78] Impairment provisions were prudently made to support this expansion , incorporating
[79] model calibrations and additional buffers for high - risk sectors, while taking into account
[80] global and local economic trends. Consequently, impairment charges for loans and advances
[81] increased by 10%, from LKR 3,577 Mn to LKR 3,938 Mn, compar ed to the previous period.
[82] Operating Expenses
[83] Technology and digital transformation remained a strategic priority for DFCC Bank, with
[84] ongoing upgrades to its IT infrastructure aimed at enhancing multi - channel service delivery
[85] and operational efficiency. In parallel, the Bank increased its investment in marketing and
[86] promotional activities to strengthen brand visibility, deepen customer engagement, and
[87] support product growth. These forward - looking initiatives are expected to deliver long - term
[88] value by expand ing market reach, accelerating customer acquisition, and reinforcing DFCC
[89] Bank ’s competitive position in a dynamic financial landscape.
[90] As a result of these strategic investments, operating expenses rose to LKR 13,348 Mn in the
[91] period ended 30 September 20 25, compared to LKR 11,341 Mn in the corresponding period
[92] last year. Despite this increase, the Bank remains firmly committed to strategic cost
[93] optimisation across all functions, to ensure sustainable growth and operational resilience.
[94] Other Comprehensive Income (OCI)
[95] OCI included fair value gains from equity and fixed - income securities, alongside movements
[96] in hedging reserves. Exchange rate volatility was minimised through hedge accounting
[97] practices.
[98] Equity securities posted a fair value gain of LKR 8,346 Mn, primarily due to an increase in
[99] the share price of Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC. Treasury bill and bond yi eld gains
[100] amounted to LKR 1,670 Mn during the same period.
[101] Financial Position Analysis
[102] Assets
[103] DFCC Bank demonstrated strong balance sheet expansion despite prevailing economic and
[104] sector - specific headwinds. Total assets grew by LKR 148 Bn, marking a 21% increase since
[105] December 2024. The Bank’s net loan portfolio rose by LKR 101 Bn to reach LKR 495 Bn,
[106] reflecting a robust 26% growth from LKR 394 Bn as at 31 December 2024.
[107] This performance aligns with DFCC Bank ’s strategic growth agenda and signals renewed

[120] As at 30 September 2025, total equity increased by LKR 2 0 Bn, supported by a profit after

[122] In alignment with the Bank’s growth strategy and the improving economic environment , the
[123] ne t loan portfolio grew by 26 %. Leveraging the strengthened eq uity base, the Bank
[124] effectively absorb ed the additional capital re quirements associated with portfolio growth.
[125] As a result, the Tier 1 Capita l Ratio was maintained at 11.806 %, while the Total Capital Ratio
[126] stood at 14.276 %, compared to 12.402% and 15.759%, respectively, as at December 2024.
[127] The Bank’s Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) stood at 1 2 1.93 %, and the Liquidity Coverage
[128] Ratio (LCR) – all currency - reached 188.69 %, both comfortably exceeding regulatory
[129] mini mums.
[130] CEO’s Statement
[131] As Sri Lanka continues its macroeconomic recovery - with interest rates easing, credit
[132] demand strengthening, and investor confidence returning, DFCC Bank’s performance in the
[133] third quarter reflects both resilience and readiness. The Bank recorded a Profit After Tax of
[134] LKR 13.3 B n at Bank level, which included a one - off gain from the strategic divestment of its
[135] 50% stake in Acuity Partners (Pvt) Ltd, underpinned by a 26% growth in the loan portfolio
[136] and a 22% increase in deposits. Core profitability remained strong, supported by disciplined
[137] credit expansion and funding optimisation.
[138] These results are a reflection of deliberate choices and shared purpose. From accelerating
[139] home ownership and mobility propositions, to deepening our engagement with Micro and
[140] SME sector entrepreneurs and remittance - receiving families, we remained focused on
[141] relevance and real impact. Our inclusive finance agenda continued to gain momentum, with
[142] DFCC Aloka surpassing 100,000 customers and the rollout of our Islamic Banking
[143] proposit ion further broadening access to ethical and faith - aligned financial services.
[144] This quarter also marked a defining step in our sustainability journey, with the
[145] announcement of Sri Lanka’s first Blue Bond - a n LKR 3 Bn initiative designed to finance
[146] ocean - positive SMEs and strengthen climate adaptation. This builds on our earlier
[147] leadership in green finance, including the triple green bond listings across Colombo,
[148] Luxembourg, and GIFT City in India, further cementing DFCC Bank’s role as a catalyst for
[149] sustainable capital.
[150] At ground level, our teams continued to bring the Bank’s purpose to life through nationwide
[151] activations such as the Mega Town Storm ing campaign s and participation in regional fairs,
[152] creating direct engagement and tangible value for co mmunities. These collective efforts
[153] reinforce not just our market position, but our character as a purpose - driven institution built
[154] on connection and service.
[155] As DFCC Bank celebrates its 70th year, the Bank remains deeply grateful to its customers and
[156] stak eholders for their continuing trust, understanding, and confidence. T his performance of
[157] the period further reflects a powerful balance between financial strength and strategic
[158] foresight. Our fundamentals are strong, our purpose is clear, and our direction is focused -
[159] to deliver meaningful growth, responsible innovation, and sustained value for Sri Lankans
[160] everywhere.

[870] Fair Values of Financial Instruments
[871] Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value
[872] The following is a description of how fair values are determined for financial instruments that are recorded at fair value using valuation
[873] techniques. These incorporate the Bank’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
[874] (a) Derivatives
[875] Derivative products valued with market-observable inputs are mainly currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. Such
[876] valuations incorporate various inputs such as foreign exchange spot and forward rates.
[877] (b) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income
[878] Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income are valued using valuation techniques or pricing models primarily
[879] consisted of unquoted equities.
[880] (c) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
[881] Quoted Equities and Sri Lanka Government Securities - are included under Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss are
[882] valued using market prices.
[883] Determination of Fair Value and Fair Value Hierarchy
[884] The Bank uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique.
[885] Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
[886] Level 2: Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or
[887] indirectly.
[888] Level 3: Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market
[889] data.
[890] The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments and non financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value by level of
[891] fair value hierarchy

[965] Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities not Carried at Fair Value
[966] The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not
[967] already recorded at fair value in the Financial Statements.
[968] Assets for which Fair Value Approximates Carrying Value
[969] For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short term maturity, it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair
[970] value. This assumption is applied for Cash and Cash Equivalents, Balances with Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Placements with Banks and
[971] Securities Purchased under Re-sale Agreements. This assumption is also applied to demand deposits, savings accounts without a specific
[972] maturity, floating rate instruments and fixed rate instruments having maturities within 12 months.
[973] Fixed Rate Financial Instruments
[974] The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities (other than assets and liabilities with maturities within 12 months) carried at
[975] amortised cost are estimated by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates for similar
[976] financial instruments.
[977] Reconciliation of Level 3 fair values
[978] The following table shows a reconciliation from the opening balances to the closing balances for Level 3 fair values.

[989] Sensitivity analysis
[990] For the fair values of equity securities, reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the significant unobservable inputs,
[991] holding other inputs constant, would have the following effects.
