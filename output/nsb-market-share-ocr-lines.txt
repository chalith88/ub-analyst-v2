[1] th
[2] For the Nine Months Ended 30 September 2025
[3] National Savings Bank Group Posts Strong 3Q 2025 Growth with 3 0 % Surge in Profit Before
[4] Tax to Rs. 3 4 . 8 billion
[5] • Total deposits increased to Rs 1.6 trillion
[6] • Stage 3 loan ratio reduced to 2.63%
[7] • Capital Adequacy ratio at 24%
[8] National Savings Bank Group (NSB) reported a solid performance for the nine months ended 30
[9] September 2025, delivering sharp improvements in profitability, margins and asset quality
[10] despite a moderating interest - rate environment. The state - owned savings gi ant recorded a Profit
[11] Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 3 4 . 8 billion, up 3 0 %, while Profit After Tax (PAT) surged 32% to Rs. 21.2
[12] billion.
[13] Chairman Dr. Harsha Cabral PC said the results highlight the Bank’s ability to uphold its dual
[14] mandate of safeguarding nationa l savings and supporting state financing, while maintaining
[15] strong profitability. General Manager/CEO Ms. Shashi Kandambi noted that disciplined balance -
[16] sheet management, improved margins and sustained investments in technology and staff
[17] contributed to the strong performance.
[18] Strong growth in core earnings
[19] Despite a slight moderation in total income due to lower market rates, core profitability
[20] strengthened significantly. A 1 5.8 % reduction in interest expenses, driven by active liability
[21] management, led to an 1 6.8 % increase in Net Interest Income (NII) to Rs. 6 4.4 billion. The Net
[22] Interest Margin improved to 4.7 1 %. Furthermore, net fee and commission income grew by 26. 3 %,
[23] and other non - interest income rose by nearly 62.5 %, contributing to a 1 8 .4% expansion i n total
[24] operating income compared to the same period last year .
[25] Disciplined Cost Management and Improved Asset Quality Drive Profit Growth
[26] Operating expenses increased due to wage adjustments and digital investments, but the cost - to -
[27] income ratio remained steady at 3 8.28 %, demonstrating solid cost control. After absorbing
[28] financial service levies of Rs. 10. 6 billion (VAT and SSCL) and an income tax expense of Rs. 13. 6
[29] billion that rose in line with higher earnings, NSB delivered a Profit After Tax (PAT) of Rs. 21.2 billion
[30] a strong year - on - year increase of over 32%.
[31] This robust bottom - line performance was supported by a dramatic improvement in asset quality
[32] and an exceptionally fortified capital base. The Stage 3 impaired loan (NPL) ratio more than
[33] halved, falling sharply to 2.63% from 5.18% at the end of 2024. At the same time, the Stage 3
[34] impairment coverage ratio increased to 59.36% (2024: 44.50%), underscoring the Bank’s
[35] conservative provisioning stance and resilience against potential credit sh ocks. Concurrently,
[36] the Bank's capital buffers remained strong, with a Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 21.92 % and a Total
[37] Capital Ratio of 23.89 %, both well above regulatory requirements. This reinforced financial
[38] foundation directly translated into enhanced profi tability, with key metrics showing significant
[39] improvement: the Return on Assets (before tax) rose to 2. 54 % from 1. 63 %, and the Return on
[40] Equity increased substantially to 2 4.67 % from 18. 15 %, evidencing greater earnings generation.
[41] 1
[42] Strengthened balance s heet and sound liquidity
[43] NSB’s total assets rose to Rs. 1.8 7 trillion, up 5.3 % from end - 2024, supported primarily by
[44] increased investments in government securities. Loans and advances stood at Rs. 51 9 billion,
[45] marginally lower due to selective lending effo rts.
[46] Customer deposits increased to Rs. 1.59 trillion, reaffirming strong depositor confidence.
[47] Liquidity remained a standout strength, with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) exceeding 349%
[48] and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) at 195%, all far above re gulatory requirements.
[49] Supporting the State and advancing national priorities
[50] During the period, NSB contributed over Rs. 2 4.1 billion in taxes on financial services and income
[51] tax, reinforcing its role as a key supporter of public finance , in addition to the Bank’s ongoing role
[52] as a major investor in government securities and a conduit for funding to key state - owned
[53] enterprises.
[54] The Chairman , Dr Cabral noted that NSB will continue expanding access to financial services
[55] through its island - wide branch network and over 4,000 postal banking outlets. The General
[56] Manager/CEO , Ms Kandambi added that the strong 3Q performance provides a firm foundation
[57] for the Bank’s continued focus on digital banking, sustainable growth and enhanced governance.
[58] With stronger earnings, high liquidity, solid capital buffers and improving asset quality, NSB
[59] enters the final quarter of 2025 in a robust position. The Bank remains c ommitted to its national
[60] mandate protecting public savings, supporting government funding needs and driving inclusive,
[61] sustainable financial progress across Sri Lanka.

[146] Explanatory Notes :-
[147] 1. There are no changes to the accounting policies and methods of computation since the publication of annual accounts for the year 2024.
[148] 2. The comparable information is re-classified as wherever necessary to compare with the current year's classification in order to provide a better
[149] presentation.
[150] 3. Impairment Assessment
[151] Individual impairment assessment were done for the customers who have exceeded the threshold limit. They were assessed individually based
[152] on their historical payment patterns, economic recession impact to their sectors and expected recovery of the sector, financial strength of the
[153] entity and other holistic factors. The portfolio level impairment assessment was carried out for the other borrowers. Based on the assessment
[154] some borrowers were moved from stage one to stage two and some borrowers were moved from stage two to stage three (due to expected
[155] cashflow impairment) despite of their past due status. The Bank closely monitors and considers the impact of economy to business operations
[156] and performance. In order to capture the expected losses from loans and advances due to prevalent economic conditions, the Bank adjusted the
[157] economic factor adjustment.
