[571] ASSETS & LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE - FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY
[572] 14
[573] Level 1
[574] Inputs that are quoted market prices (unadjusted) in an active market for identical instruments.
[575] Accordingly, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using active quoted prices or dealer price quotations without any deduction for transaction costs, if available. A
[576] market is regarded as active if transactions for assets and liabilities take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
[577] Level 2
[578] Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
[579] This category includes instruments valued using;
[580] a. quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments,
[581] b. quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are considered to be less active, or
[582] c. other valuation techniques in which almost all significant inputs are directly or indirectly observable from market data.
[583] Level 3
[584] Inputs that are unobservable.
[585] This category includes all instruments for which the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable data and the unobservable inputs that have a significant effect
[586] on the instruments' valuation.
[587] This category also includes instruments that are valued based on quoted prices of similar instruments for which significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are
[588] required to reflect difference between the instruments.
[589] Valuation techniques include net present value and discounted cash flow models, comparison with similar instruments for which observable market prices exist. Assumptions
[590] and inputs used in valuation techniques include risk-free and benchmark interest rates, risk premiums in estimating discount rates, bond and equity prices, foreign exchange
[591] rates, expected price volatilities and corrections.
[592] There are no material changes in the fair value of financial assets categorised under Level 3 compared to the values reported as at December 31, 2024. The Bank continued to
[593] use the valuation models and assumptions used to measure the fair values of Level 3 financial instruments as at December 31, 2024, during the period ended September 30,
[594] 2025, as well.
[595] The following table provides an analysis of assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value
[596] measurement is categorised. These amounts were based on the values recognised in the Statement of Financial Position:
