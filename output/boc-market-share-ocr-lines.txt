[20] performance, reflecting both strategic focus and disciplined execution. The Bank recorded a Profit
[21] before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 87.7 billion, a remarkable 133% increase compared to Rs. 37.6 billion in

[28] strategic repricing strategies .
[29] Non-fund-based income also played a vital role in boosting overall earnings. Net fee and commission
[30] income increased by 11% to Rs. 16.8 billion, driven by growing customer engagement in digital
[31] channels, card usage, retail transactions, and remittance flows.
[32] Total operating income rose 61% to Rs. 181.1 billion, while operating expenses increased by only
[33] 6% to Rs. 51.8 billion, reflecting effective cost management. This resulted in a notable improvement
[34] in operational efficiency, with the Bank achieving a cost-to-income ratio of 32%.
[35] Operating profit before taxes on financial services rose to Rs. 111.1 billion and after accounting for
[36] Rs. 23.4 billion in taxes on financial services and Rs. 31.9 billion in income tax expense, the Bank

[43] charge of Rs. 18.7 billion on loans and advances, reflecting its prudent approach to addressing
[44] expected credit losses.
[45] The Stage 3 loan ratio stood at 6.69%, with further improvements anticipated as ongoing recovery
[46] initiatives and strengthened collection efforts continue to yield positive outcomes. The Stage 3
[47] provision coverage ratio remained strong at 56.24%, underscoring BOC’s commitment to
[48] conservative provisioning and sound risk practices, reinforcing confidence in the Bank’s financial
[49] resilience.

[51] As of 30 September 2025, BOC’s total assets stood at Rs. 5.5 trillion, reflecting a solid upsurge of
[52] 11% YTD. This growth was largely fueled by investments in government securities and securities

[54] its ability to leverage favorable market conditions.
[55] Gross loans and advances increased to Rs. 2.5 trillion, signaling growing credit demand during the

[424] EXPLANATORY NOTES 7
[425] I. The interim Financial Statements are presented in accordance with Sri Lanka Accounting
[426] Standard - LKAS 34 on “Interim Financial Reporting”. These condensed Interim Financial
[427] Statements should be read in conjunction with the Annual Financial Statements for the year
[428] ended 31 December 2024. In order to conform to better presentation, previous year figures
[429] and phrases have been adjusted where relevant.

[431] publication of Annual Financial Statements for the year 2024.

[434] financial statements.
[435] IV. The Bank evaluated the significant increase in credit risk of Individually Significant Loan

[442] (FVTOCI) to Amortized Cost (AC) with effect from 01 April 2022. If the current portfolio

[445] VI. In the comparative period, the interest income on certain exposures of State Owned
