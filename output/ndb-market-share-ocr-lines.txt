[23] FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
[24] National Development Bank PLC, released its financial results for the nine months ended
[25] September 30, 2025, to the Colombo Stock Exchange recently. The results showcase impressive
[26] profitability growth backed by sound core banking operational growth as evidenced by net
[27] operating income and pre-tax profit expands by 32.3% and 62.1% to reach LKR 28.4 billion
[28] and LKR 11.0 billion, respectively (9M-24: LKR 21.5 billion and LKR 6.8 billion).
[29] Fund based income
[30] Net interest income improved by 6.4% to LKR 25.9 billion over 2024. This is noteworthy
[31] considering the tapering interest rate environment which prevailed during the period under
[32] review. R eflecting the Bank’s efforts to diligently maintain its margins, Net Interest Margins
[33] broadly stabilized at 4.1% (2024: 4.3%) which, excluding items of a one-off nature, was 4.3%
[34] on a like for like basis (2024: 4.5%). At end September 2025, the Bank had close to LKR 46.8
[35] billion in Loans and Deposits under a special arrangement with its customer(s) with a netting-off
[36] feature (end 2024: LKR 19.6 billion).
[37] Non-fund based income
[38] Net fee and commission income grew by 13.8% to reach LKR 5.8 billion YoY, whilst for the third
[39] quarter alone it reported an impressive 24.2% over the third quarter of 2024. This evidenced
[40] targeted efforts made to strengthen non-fund sources of income, thereby enhancing the resilience
[41] of the Bank’s overall income composition. This growth was enabled by improved performance
[42] across almost all aspects of the Bank’s core business operations.
[43] Credit and operating costs
[44] Impairment charges continued to decline, driven by concerted efforts to enhance the quality of the
[45] loan book, resulting in a charge of LKR 5.9 billion for the period under review, representing a
[46] 46.7% reduction YoY. The resultant total impairment coverage ratio, excluding such one-off items
[47] of a special nature stood at 8.8% (end 2024:10.1%); which compared well with industry
[48] averages at the said period end. Operating expenses netted LKR 13.9 billion, marking a 14.8%
[49] YoY increase - predominantly driven by staff related routine increments and realignments to the
[50] Classification: External Confidential

[52] .
[53] industry, and higher investments in IT infrastructure and those of a direct business development
[54] nature.

[67] 460.7 billion, 27.1% growth). Excluding transactions of a one off and special nature, this

[69] The Bank’ s CASA ratio on a normalized basis was 23.8% having improved from 22.5% at end

[450] Rule 7.4 of the Colombo Stock Exchange and Circular No 05 of 2024 of Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
[451] Expected Credit Losses
[452] 3
[453] The Bank assessed the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) of credit facilities based on two approaches of individual and collective basis. The customers who have been identified
[454] as individually significant were assessed under individual basis and they were staged based on the identified indicators of increase in credit risks.
[455] The Expected Credit Losses assessed on collective impairment approach were based on Probability of Default (PD), Loss Given Default (LGD) and the Economic Factor
[456] Adjustment (EFA) by applying the recent forecasts and projections. Further, the Bank has accounted for management overlays to mitigate any expected losses by
[457] downgrading the staging of facilities included in the identified risk elevated industries where necessary to capture significant increases in credit risk due to stressed
[458] economic conditions.
[459] 4 From total debt investment portfolio ,the Bank has reclassified the Debt portfolio amounting to LKR 37.7 Bn, consisting of Sri Lanka Government Treasury Bonds of LKR 32.6
[460] Bn and Sri Lanka USD Sovereign Bonds of USD 14 Mn held as “Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income” to “Amortised cost” with effect from 01 April 2022. This

[463] restructured in December 2024.
[464] If these investments continued to be carried at fair value through other comprehensive income, the fair value of the remaining portfolio as at 30 September 2025 would
[465] have amounted to LKR 2.9 Bn and would have resulted in the recognition of fair value gain of LKR 104.5 Mn in other comprehensive income during the period.
[466] 5 Dividends
[467] On 03 March 2025, the Board of Directors approved and declared a final Dividend of LKR 8.00 per share, of which LKR 5.00 was in the form of cash dividend and the balance
[468] LKR 3.00 was in the form of scrip dividend for the financial year ended 31 December 2024 . Accordingly 9,415,842 ordinary voting shares have been listed as scrip dividends
[469] on 24 March 2025. As a result, the stated capital of the Bank increased to LKR 22.9 Bn (31 December 2024 - LKR 21.7 Bn).

[750] Classification: Public
[751] FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
[752] Fair Values of Financial Instruments are determined according to the following hierarchy as described below:
[753] Level 1 - quoted market price (unadjusted): financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets
[754] Level 2 - valuation techniques using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or
[755] similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments are valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
[756] Level 3 - valuation techniques with significant unobservable inputs: This category includes all instruments valued using valuation techniques where one or more
[757] significant inputs are unobservable.
[758] There were no material transfers between levels of fair value hierarchy during the current period of 2025. The Bank did not changed the valuation models and
[759] assumptions used to measure the fair values of Level 03 financial instruments during the year ended 31 December 2024.
