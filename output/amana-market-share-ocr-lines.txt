[300] NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
[301] 01. ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BY MEASUREMENT BASIS
[302] Financial instruments are measured on an ongoing basis either at fair value or at amortised cost. The summary of significant accounting policies stated in the
[303] Annual Financial Statements describes how the classes of financial instruments are measured, and how income and expenses, including fair value gains and
[304] losses, are recognised. The following table analyses the carrying amounts of the financial instruments by category as defined in SLFRS 9 and by headings of the
[305] Statement of Financial Position.

[452] All financial assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value heirarchy, as
[453] described below.
[454] • Level 1 Quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and / or debt
[455] instruments.
[456] • Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e.
[457] derived from prices).
[458] Inputs for asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity and / or debt

[512] The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not already recorded at
[513] fair value in the Financial Statements:
[514] Balances with Banks, Balances with Licensed Finance Companies, Other Financial Assets and Other Financial Liabilities
[515] For the above, the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair values.
[516] Financial Assets at Amortised Cost - Financing and Receivables to Other Customers
[517] The fair value of the above are estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the prevailing market rates for financing as of the reporting
[518] date with similar credit risks and maturities (Level 3).
[519] Financial Liabilities at Amortised Cost - Due to Depositors
[520] The fair values of the above are deemed to approximate their carrying amounts as rate of returns are determined at the end of their holding periods based
[521] on the profit generated from the relevant investments.
