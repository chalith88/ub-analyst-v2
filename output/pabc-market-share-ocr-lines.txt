[30] Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC reported a stellar financial performance for the nine months
[31] ended 30th September 2025, reaffirming its resilience and strategic agility amid a gradually
[32] recovering yet challenging macroeconomic environment. The Bank record ed a 36% increase in
[33] Profit After Tax (PAT) , reaching Rs. 3.02 billion , and an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 6.83 ,
[34] reflecting strong portfolio and cost management, coupled with a steadfast commitment to
[35] sustainable profitability.
[36] The Bank’s unwavering commitment to maintaining superior asset quality was demonstrated by
[37] sustaining one of the lowest Stage 3 Loan Ratios in the industry at 2.06% as of 30th September
[38] 2025 - reflecting the strength of its prudent credit risk management and robust underwriting
[39] practices. Despite temporary challenges arising from the restrictions that was in force on loan
[40] recoveries, the Bank proactively recalibrated its recovery strategies to mitigate potential impacts
[41] and preserve portfolio integrity. Reinf orcing this disciplined approach, the Stage 3 Provision
[42] Coverage improved to 60.86% from 60.10% at the previous year - end, supported by prudent
[43] impairment provisioning across borrowers and sectors exhibiting signs of financial stress.
[44] In line with the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka’s policy rate reductions, market
[45] interest rates on both lending and deposits continued to moderate during the period. As a result,
[46] the Bank’s gross interest income for the nine months ended 30th September 2025 recorded a
[47] marginal decline of 2% compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, despite the
[48] significant growth in the average loan portfolio. However, the lower interest rate environment
[49] also led to an 8% reduction in intere st expenses, reflecting effective deposit repricing and
[50] disciplined liability management. Consequently, net interest income rose by 8% , as the decline
[51] in interest expenses more than offset the marginal contraction in interest income, underscoring
[52] the Bank’s sound balance sheet management and margin optimization strategies.
[53] The Bank achieved a remarkable 38% growth in net fee and commission income during the
[54] period under review, underpinned by strong demand for loans and advances in a low - interest
[55] rate environment and favourable macroeconomic conditions. This robust performance reflects
[56] the Bank’s ability to capitalize on market opportunities while delivering value to its clients.
[57] Additionally, fee income from trade and remittance services recorded substantial growth, further
[58] demonstrating the Bank’s diversified revenue capabi lities and operational strength.
[59] Net gains from trading declined by 39% during the reporting period, attributable to lower
[60] capital gains from both investments in unit trusts and Sri Lanka Government Rupee Securities
[61] classified under FVPL. However, net fair value losses on financial assets at FVPL decreased during
[62] the first nine months of 2025, owing to reduced mark - to - market losses on Sri Lanka Gover nment
[63] Rupee Securities. The Bank also recorded a notable capital gain of Rs. 263 million as
[64] derecognition gains on financial assets classified under FVOCI.
[65] The Bank’s Cost - to - Income Ratio improved significantly by 419 basis points, declining from
[66] 52.68% in 2024 to 48.49% for the nine months ended September 2025. This improvement
[67] reflects both strong earnings growth and disciplined cost management, underscoring the Bank’s
[68] commitment to operational efficiency and sustainable profitabi lity.
[69] This deliberate investment reinforces the Bank’s focus on attracting, retaining, and developing
[70] high - caliber professionals who are essential for delivering superior customer experiences,
[71] fostering innovation, and sustaining long - term shareholder value. Whi le personnel costs have
[72] risen, these strategic expenditures are fully aligned with the Bank’s objectives of enhancing
[73] operational capacity, accelerating digital transformation, and building a future - ready workforce.
[74] This improvement reflects effective cost management strategies, with other operating expenses
[75] contained in terms of 11 % increase , despite additional expenditure related to new branch
[76] openings, technological enhancement projects, and general inflationary pressures on goods and
[77] services.
[78] Taxes and levies on financial services recorded an increase during the period, primarily driven
[79] by the growth in operating profits. This trend reflects the Bank’s strong financial performance
[80] and reinforces the direct relationship between improved earnings and statutory obligations.
[81] Income tax expenses for the nine - month period rose moderately by 29%, despite a more
[82] pronounced increase in operating profitability, demonstrating the Bank’s effective tax planning
[83] and management practices. This underscores Pan Asia Bank’s prudent approach to optimizing its
[84] tax position while maintaining full regulatory compliance, thereby supporting sustainable
[85] profitability and enhancing shareholder value. In contrast, the income tax expense for the
[86] comparative quarter benefited from a one - off tax saving resulting from the successful conclusion
[87] of an income tax appeals process. This non - recurring gain reduced the overall income tax expense
[88] for that period and contributed to a lower effective tax rate compared to the current quar ter.
[89] The Bank reported a Net Interest Margin (NIM) of 4.64 % for the period under review. Return
[90] on Equity (ROE) stood at 14.46%, while Pre - Tax Return on Assets (ROA) reached 2.11%,
[91] reflecting the Bank’s capacity to deliver strong returns to shareholders. These results were
[92] underpinned by robust earnings growth, o perational efficiencies, effective asset utilization, and
[93] prudent risk management practices, collectively contributing to enhanced profitability.
[94] Total assets grew by 12%, driven primarily by an expansion in loans and advances, which
[95] increased by 26% across the SME Banking, Corporate Banking, and Retail Banking segments due
[96] to heightened credit demand. The Bank’s customer deposits rose by Rs. 26 bil lion, or 14%,
[97] surpassing the Rs. 217 billion by the end of the nine months of September 2025. The Current and
[98] Savings Account (CASA) ratio remained steady at 21.27%, reflecting a stable low - cost deposit
[99] base.
[100] Throughout the nine - month period, the Bank maintained a strong capital and liquidity position,
[101] reinforcing its resilience in a dynamic economic environment. Capital buffers remained well
[102] above regulatory minimums, demonstrating prudent management. The Comm on Equity Tier 1
[103] (CET1) Capital Ratio and Tier 1 Capital Ratio were 15.43%, comfortably above the regulatory
[104] thresholds of 7 .00 % and 8.5 0 %, respectively. The Total Capital Ratio stood at 17.07% versus the
[105] statutory minimum of 12.5 0 %, while the Leverage Rat io remained robust at 7.96%, well above
[106] the 3% regulatory benchmark.
[107] Liquidity levels remained strong despite significant growth in the loan book. The Bank’s All -
[108] Currency Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was 166.27%, and the Rupee LCR stood at 180.89%,
[109] both exceeding regulatory requirements. The Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR ) of 127.90%
[110] underscores the Bank’s capacity to maintain stable funding in a gradually recovering economic
[111] environment. These metrics collectively highlight the Bank’s commitment to financial stability,
[112] sustainable growth, and long - term shareholder value.
[113] As the Bank commemorates its 30th anniversary, the Bank celebrates three decades of prudent
[114] growth, financial stability, and strategic evolution. Since its establishment in 1995, P an Asia Bank
[115] has developed into a leading mid - tier bank in Sri Lanka, recognized for its strong governance
[116] framework, disciplined risk management, and consistent delivery of shareholder value.
[117] The Bank’s 2025 financial results reflect solid performance across key indicators, underscoring
[118] resilience in a dynamic economic environment. Sustained growth in the Corporate, R etail and
[119] SME segments, combined with robust capital adequacy and liquidity positions, has reinforced the
[120] Bank’s financial foundation. The Bank continues to demonstrate strong cost discipline and asset
[121] quality, positioning it well for long - term profitability and sustainable expansion.
[122] The Chairman, Mr. Aravinda Perera, remarked, “For three decades, the Bank has consistently
[123] evolved to meet the demands of a dynamic financial landscape. Guided by a resilient balance
[124] sheet, a culture of innovation, and a commitment to excellence, we have d elivered sustainable
[125] value to our shareholders and earned the trust of our stakeholders. As we look to the future, we
[126] are strategically positioned to lead the next era of banking - driving innovation, expanding our
[127] footprint, and creating long - term, enduri ng growth for all our stakeholders.”
[128] Naleen Edirisinghe, Director and Chief Executive Officer of Pan Asia Bank, commented:
[129] “Pan Asia Bank’s strong performance during the first nine months of 2025 reflects our disciplined
[130] execution and unwavering focus on value creation. Despite a dynamic operating environment, we
[131] achieved steady growth and improved profitability, underscoring the strength of our core banking
[132] strategy and the trust our customers continue to place in us. As we enter the next phase of our growth
[133] strategy, we are investing in digital transformation, advanced risk management, and trade finance
[134] capabilities. These strategic initiatives are designed to enhance operational efficiency, deepen
[135] market penetration, and align with global best practices in banking and sustainability - enabling us
[136] to unlock long - term value and deliver sustainable growth for all stakeholders.” .
[137] With a renewed strategic focus on technology - driven banking, ESG integration, and prudent
[138] capital management, Pan Asia Bank aims to strengthen its position as a trusted financial partner
[139] within Sri Lanka and beyond. The Bank’s 30 - year legacy stands as a te stament to its commitment
[140] to transparency, innovation, and long - term value creation for investors.
[141] Recording consistent growth year after year, Pan Asia Bank is strongly positioned as the ‘Truly
[142] Sri Lankan Bank’, marking an illustrious journey that has promoted financial security and fulfilled
[143] the aspirations of its customers while supporting the prospe rity of the nation.

[481] 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments
[482] 5.1 Financial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value
[483] The following is a description of how fair values are determined for financial instruments that are recorded at fair value using valuation techniques. These
[484] incorporate the Bank’s estimate of assumptions that a market participant would make when valuing the instruments.
[485] (a) Derivatives
[486] Derivative products valued with market-observable inputs are mainly currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts. The most frequently applied
[487] valuation techniques include forward exchange spot and forward premiums.
[488] (b) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income
[489] FVOCI financial assets primarily consist of unquoted equity securities and government securities. Government securities are valued using the published yield
[490] curves while unquoted equity securities are valued using prices of similar assets in quoted market prices in the active markets as at the reporting date.
[491] (c) Financial Assets at Fair Value through Profit or Loss
[492] FVPL financial assets measured at fair value are the government securities and units trust securities. Sri Lanka government securities are valued using yield curves
[493] published by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The Bank uses net asset values of units as at the reporting date as the market value of units.
[494] (d) Property, Plant & Equipment
[495] Freehold land and buildings are carried at revalued amount, being their fair value at the revaluation date less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and
[496] subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
[497] 5.2 Determination of Fair Value and Fair Value Hierarchy
[498] The Bank uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique.
[499] Level 1 : Quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
[500] Level 2 : Other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
[501] Level 3 : Techniques which use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
[502] Also, the Bank has not changed the valuation models and assumptions used to measure the fair values of Level 3 financial instruments/assets during the 9 months
[503] period 2025. Further, there are no material changes in the fair value of financial assets categorised under Level 3, compared to the values reported as at 31st
[504] December 2024.
[505] The following table shows an analysis of financial instruments and non-financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value by level of fair value hierarchy.

[542] 5.3 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Carried at Fair Value
[543] The following describes the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not already recorded at fair
[544] value in the Financial Statements.
[545] Assets for which Fair Value Approximates Carrying Value
[546] For financial assets and liabilities that have a short term maturity, it is assumed that the carrying value approximates their fair value. This assumption is applied
[547] for Cash and Cash Equivalents, Balances with Central Bank of Sri Lanka and Reverse Repurchase Agreements. This assumption is also applied to Call Money
[548] Borrowings, Balances with Foreign Banks, Repurchase Agreements, Demand Deposits, Margin Deposits, Savings Accounts without a specific maturity, floating
[549] rate instruments and fixed rate instrumemts having maturities within 12 months.
[550] Fixed Rate Financial Instruments
[551] The fair value of fixed rate financial assets and liabilities (other than assets and liabilities with maturities within 12 months) carried at amortised cost are estimated
[552] by comparing market interest rates when they were first recognised with current market rates for similar financial instruments.
[553] Set out below is a comparison, by class, of the carrying value and fair value of the Bank’s financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in the Financial
[554] Statements. This table does not include the fair value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities.
