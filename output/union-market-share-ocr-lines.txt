[27] business growth.

[385] EXPLANATORY NOTES
[386] As at 30 September 2025
[387] 1 There are no changes to the accounting policies and methods of computation since the publication of the annual financial statements for the year 2024.
[388] 2 In accordance with the Statement of Alternative Treatment (SoAT) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka on the reclassification of the debt portfolio, the Bank has
[389] classified LKR 18,893 Mn of the debt portfolio from Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income to Amortised Cost category on 30 June 2022 as holding these instruments in the
[390] fair value through other comprehensive income category was not commercially viable in the current economic environment. The cumulative losses from these instruments previously
[391] recognised in Other Comprehensive Income has been removed from equity and adjusted against the fair value of the financial asset at the reclassification date. Accordingly, the
[392] reclassified assets have been measured at the reclassification date as if they had always been measured at Amortised Cost. The cumulative losses and the fair value as at 30 September
[393] 2025 if the assets have continued to be measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income amounts to LKR 32 Mn and LKR 2,487 Mn respectively.
[394] 3 The Bank had issued 218,281,250 warrants to be exercised within a period of 6 years at a price of LKR 16 per warrant. Given the Bank does not have an immediate need for new capital,
[395] with the request of Culture Financial Holdings, the Board of Directors of the Bank decided to extend the exercise period of the warrants until 31 March 2025 and revise the exercise price
[396] to a price that is equivalent to the average closing price per share for the five day period that immediately precedes the exercise of warrants. The Bank has obtained the concurrence of the
[397] Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka for the extension of the warrants’ exercise period and the revision to the exercise price, as described
[398] above.Further extension has been given by the letter dated 13 December 2024 by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to extend the period until 31 December 2025. By the letter dated 28
[399] March 2025, the Securities and Exchange Commission has granted approval to extend the exercise period of warrants only up to the extent of the shortfall of LKR 500Mn to meet the
[400] minimum capital requirment of LKR 20Bn and the rest of the warrants deemed to have been expired on 31 March 2025.
[401] 4 There are no material changes during the period in the composition of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. All known expenditure items have been provided for.
[402] 5 These Interim financial statements are presented in accordance with LKAS 34 - "Interim Financial Reporting" and provide the information as required in terms of Rule 7.4 of the

[798] FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
[799] All financial assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, as discribed
[800] below;
[801] Fair values are determined according to the following hierarchy:
[802] Level 1 – quoted market price (unadjusted): financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets.
[803] Level 2 – valuation technique using observable inputs: financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar
[804] instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments are valued using models where all significant inputs are observable.
[805] Level 3 – valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs: This category includes all instruments valued using valuation techniques where
[806] one or more significant inputs are unobservable.
[807] The following table provides an analysis of assets and liabilities measured at fair value as at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair
[808] value measurement is categorised. These amounts were based on the values recognised in the Statement of Financial Position:
